# Go library to communicate with NFC portals

### Supported devices
- Datel's *PowerSaves for Amiibo*

### Should be supported
- NaMiio *NFC Backup System*
- MaxLander

From all the information found online, these two devices are **identical** to
Datel's *PowerSaves for Amiibo* device but due to the lack of access to the
hardware and the fact that they're no longer commercially available they remain
untested.
**Anyone out there care to have a go and post a report?**

### Would be cool to also support
- All amiibo related devices from Datel
- N2Elite USB reader/writer

Ideally hardware access to these devices is needed. Alternatively a full
wireshark dump of **all** operations would also be helpful.
**Or just create a pull request yourself!**
